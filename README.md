# Developer Portfolio built with Next.js and Cosmic

To build this app, weâ€™re going to use the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) - A React framework for production that makes it easy to spin up a full-stack application.
- [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) - A Headless CMS enables the independence of the data (content) layer and gives us the ability to quickly manage template content.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A performant utility-first CSS framework that can be composed directly in your markup.

You'll need to create an .env file in the root of the project. Log in to Cosmic and from Bucket Settings > API Access take the following values:

```
//.env
COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG=your_cosmic_slug
COSMIC_READ_KEY=your_cosmic_read_key
COSMIC_PREVIEW_SECRET=your_preview_secret


Install the dependencies with

```
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```
pnpm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
