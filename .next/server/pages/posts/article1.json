And Operating\nsystem.\nAs I thought. I need to purchase new books to study to keep pace with my course.\nBut after carefully going through all topics. I noticed I don't need to buy any resources to study Whichever few subjects such as python. I have all materials.\n\nEven though my books were published 20 years before. **My Java complete reference **published in 2003.\n\nIt is still relevant for my academic study. As it covers 90â„… of my need. As I am not going to in detail as I have more than 14 subjects in my curriculum. Java is one of my eg.\n\nHere few points drawn as a conclusion.\n\nDon't blindly run behind every programming language hot in the current market.\n\nFOCUS ON FUNDAMENTALS\n\nMost technologies evolve with time. It is not easy to replace with a new funky easy-\nto-use or learn technology stack or programming languages time-tested stack.\n\nFor example, GO is a general-purpose language developed by google. But it can not suddenly, be replaced by C language overnight. It's a slow and tedious process. so go developers had to be patient as the market adopts it.\n\n After so many decades still, digital computers understand 0 & 1. Still, we can't use our natural language as a computer programming language.\n\nThere are so many things that are the same.\nBut It's nice to see what lies in the future.\n# Some worthy classical mentions\n- Modern operating systems by Andrew S. Tanenbaum\n- Java: The Complete Reference by Herbert Schildt\n- Head First C# by Andrew Stellman.\n- Let Us C by Yashwant Kanetkar\n- OBJECT ORIENTED Programming WITH C++ by E. Balagurusamy\n\n\n\n\nRecently I read this amazing article which supports this argument.\nhttps://www.toptal.com/c/after-all-these-years-the-world-is-still-powered-by-c-programming\n\n\n"}},"morePosts":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
