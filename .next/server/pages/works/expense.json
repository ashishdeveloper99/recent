","content":"## Introduction\n\nI recently took it upon myself to make an upgrade to stefankudla.com, making the switch from WordPress to the technologies that I am currently learning and applying in my works. The newly re-engineered stefankudla.com is created with Next.js, Tailwind, and Cosmic.js, wielding the nimble powers of the Jamstack!\n\n## Purpose and Goal\n\nAs I am moving away from WordPress development and toward JavaScript development, I wanted to take on a project that would push my limits, and improve my online presence.\n\nI felt that while having a personal website built on WordPress got the job done, it just didn't represent who I was as a developer. Ultimately, I now have the freedom to show my true potential while continuously implementing awesome features to my website.\n\n## Tools used\n\n- Next.js\n- TypeScript\n- Tailwind\n- Cosmic.js\n- Node.js\n- Framer Motion\n\n## Spotlight\n\nMy favorite thing about this project isn't actually something that you can see on the UI or in the code, but  rather a lesson I learned from building it.\n\nI learned that confidence is required to be a developer and build projects. Sometimes it's all about jumping into something, knowing that you know *absolutely nothing* about what you're trying to do, but trusting that you have the persistence to find the solution.\n\nWhile I am proud of the minimal layout of the site and the way it makes API calls  to retrieve my blog posts and works, I am just happy to have been able to take the time to learn the ins and outs of programming and apply it to my website.\n\n## Challenges\n\nTypeScript was the first major challenge. Prior to building this site, I had little to no experience typing my JavaScript code. I tried my best to stay consistent and avoid code smells, though I now have a solid understanding of TypeScript, and how it optimized JavaScript.\n\n## Main Takeaways\n\nI think it's good to be proud of the projects you build. That is time *you* spent writing code that *you* made functional, and it feels good when everything is shipped and deployed. I genuinely look forward to writing production level code with an awesome team.\n\n[Website Link](https://stefankudla.com/)\n\n"}},"morePosts":[{"slug":"article1","title":"Why Your Programming Skills will not gonna Obsolete as Fast as You ThinK","created_at":"2022-10-23T13:34:52.683Z","metadata":{"category":{"id":"635544bf7b83fb0009ddea10","slug":"learning","title":"Learning","content":"","metafields":[],"bucket":"6354f3b5acf3aa0009ff80e3","created":"2022-10-23T13:42:23.251Z","created_at":"2022-10-23T13:42:23.251Z","modified_at":"2022-10-23T13:42:23.251Z","status":"published","locale":null,"published_at":"2022-10-23T13:42:23.251Z","type":"post-categories"},"cover_image":{"url":"https://cdn.cosmicjs.com/d60325c0-56a0-11ed-a7ee-25fc4f2fdbad-IMG20221021123322.jpg","imgix_url":"https://imgix.cosmicjs.com/d60325c0-56a0-11ed-a7ee-25fc4f2fdbad-IMG20221021123322.jpg"},"excerpt":"Programming","content":"I encounter a few things about learning comp sci and programming languages.\n\nAs a part of my program, I have to learn several different programming languages like \nC, C++, PHP, Python, Java, etc. OR Databases such as Mysql. And Operating\nsystem.\nAs I thought. I need to purchase new books to study to keep pace with my course.\nBut after carefully going through all topics. I noticed I don't need to buy any resources to study Whichever few subjects such as python. I have all materials.\n\nEven though my books were published 20 years before. **My Java complete reference **published in 2003.\n\nIt is still relevant for my academic study. As it covers 90â„… of my need. As I am not going to in detail as I have more than 14 subjects in my curriculum. Java is one of my eg.\n\nHere few points drawn as a conclusion.\n\nDon't blindly run behind every programming language hot in the current market.\n\nFOCUS ON FUNDAMENTALS\n\nMost technologies evolve with time. It is not easy to replace with a new funky easy-\nto-use or learn technology stack or programming languages time-tested stack.\n\nFor example, GO is a general-purpose language developed by google. But it can not suddenly, be replaced by C language overnight. It's a slow and tedious process. so go developers had to be patient as the market adopts it.\n\n After so many decades still, digital computers understand 0 & 1. Still, we can't use our natural language as a computer programming language.\n\nThere are so many things that are the same.\nBut It's nice to see what lies in the future.\n# Some worthy classical mentions\n- Modern operating systems by Andrew S. Tanenbaum\n- Java: The Complete Reference by Herbert Schildt\n- Head First C# by Andrew Stellman.\n- Let Us C by Yashwant Kanetkar\n- OBJECT ORIENTED Programming WITH C++ by E. Balagurusamy\n\n\n\n\nRecently I read this amazing article which supports this argument.\nhttps://www.toptal.com/c/after-all-these-years-the-world-is-still-powered-by-c-programming\n\n\n"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
